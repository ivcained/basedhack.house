# Progress:

## House Scouting:

We are focused on finding a hack house in an area that is close to the main venue (60 Ratchadaphisek Rd, Khlong Toei, Bangkok 10110, Thailand).

## Cost:

Based on out average searches across airbnb and other sources online, we expect the house bill for the 20 days to be around 4000 - 7000 USD  
We are looking for sponsorship for the Hack House and Food + Beverages  
The Hack House will feature incentives for builders to build on Base.  
Currently we have found the following houses which can comfortably accommodate 15-20 hackers.
